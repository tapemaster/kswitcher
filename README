WM2

Simple Mac OS X tool for switching between apps, alternative to Cmd+Tab and Spaces.
It uses key bindings Ctrl+left_arrow, Ctrl+right_arrow, Ctrl+up_arrow and Ctrl+down_arrow.
You might want to unbind those existing shortcuts before using this tool.

I use it as an addition to Cmd+Tab, not a replacement. Though I never use Spaces.

The idea behind this switch is that there are 4-8 apps that you use during your work day, and
you switch between them quite frequently. For me standard spaces of Mac OS are  
unusable, and Cmd+Tab is kind of slow. I know what app I want to run, so I want shortest 
possible shortcuts for those.

Right now there are seven apps hardcoded, for example to run android dev studio, press 
Ctrl+Left, to run Chrome, press Ctrl+right, right.

I wrote this app for my own usage, it is absolutelly possible that your work flow differs from 
mine, so if it doesn't work for you - I don't care. If it kinda works and you wish some 
improvement - please let me know, but keep in mind that I spent verry little time creating this
app so it's very limited. My experience programming for Mac OS in Objective C and Swift is about 1 day.
